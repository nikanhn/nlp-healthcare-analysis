# NLP Healthcare Analysis

This project performs Natural Language Processing (NLP) analysis on a healthcare dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to build a model that can analyze healthcare data, which could be used for tasks like sentiment analysis of patient feedback, classification of medical records, or identifying trends in healthcare data.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Healthcare Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasad22/healthcare-dataset) from Kaggle. It contains information about patient demographics, medical conditions, treatments, and outcomes.

**Please Note:** You will need to download the dataset from the Kaggle link above and place it in a `data` directory within this project.

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/nlp-healthcare-analysis.git
    cd nlp-healthcare-analysis
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Download the data:**
    Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasad22/healthcare-dataset) and place the `healthcare_dataset.csv` file in a `data` directory.

## Usage

To run the analysis and train the model, execute the following command:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

This will load the data, preprocess it, train an NLP model, and save the model to the `models` directory.
